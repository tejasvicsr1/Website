## Some points to  Note

You will need a SASS compiler, Im using Live Sass Compiler extension on VS Code

Make changes to color variables in /scss/main.css 

Above points are covered in this video from which I have set up Bootstrap : [Bootstrap 5 Tutorial](https://youtu.be/I7CfaDYzTVM)

Make sure to use primary, secondary etc colors to make it pretty and not hardcode any color values
